# VCook

This is built for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive via SteamVR.  It uses Steamworks.net so it requires Steam to be active when playing.

There is network connection with hosting, inviting, VOIP, and State Synchronization.  Right now there is an overworld to wander around, and a kitchen that allows for the creation of a pizza.

TODO: move from overworld to kitchen, cook pizza, serve pizza, multiple types of pizza, order system
